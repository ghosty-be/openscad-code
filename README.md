- adaptation on the original code:
  - so the fields are better in the customizer (hiding $fn and making the comments for the fields better
  - like someone suggested having multiples of 0.4 extrusion for the wall and base thickness (also helps with the customizer accepting decimal point values, my experience is you can't use decimal points in the customizer if the initial value is a whole number)
